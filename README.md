## MTcars EDA and Data Visualization

This repository contains the code and results of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization performed on the MTcars dataset.

## Dataset
The MTcars dataset contains information about 32 different cars from the early 1970s. It includes various characteristics such as horsepower, number of cylinders, weight, and miles per gallon (mpg).

## EDA
The EDA performed on this dataset included examining the structure and summary statistics of the data, identifying missing values, and exploring relationships between the different variables. This was done using various functionalities in Numpy and pandas library in python

## Data Visualization
To better understand the relationships between the variables in the MTcars dataset, several data visualizations were created. These included scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and bar charts. The visualizations were created using Matplotlib and seaborn libraries in python and provide insights into the relationships between variables such as horsepower and mpg.

## Conclusion:

The EDA and data visualization performed on the MTcars dataset provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the cars included in the dataset. These insights can be used to inform further analysis or to guide decision-making in the automotive industry.
